Optical properties such as absorption, transition, radiation and reflection of light in bimetallic nanoparticles such as silver-gold can be changed due to temperature and particle size. Today, bimetallic nanoparticles are widely used because bimetallic nanoparticles have more catalytic properties. Such characteristics are very useful in scientific and technological advances. For example, a combination of the same atomic concentration of silver nanoparticles is used in various catalytic reactions to increase the surface area and decrease the density. The plasmonic coupling between the nanoparticles creates an interesting optical property. The surface-excited electrons show a characteristic absorption that leads to the scattering of the colored nanoparticles. The absorption wavelength of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to individual elements is dependent. Therefore, SPR of bimetallic nanoparticles shows the internal distribution of elements. The most important characteristics of nanoparticles are that they can penetrate into cells and release bioactive ions. For example, gold-silver nanoparticles show higher quality antibacterial activity against pathogenic bacteria. Nanofluids consisting of bimetallic nanoparticles (gold-silver in water) increase the conductivity of fluids.

  Currently, scientists are synthesizing these nanoparticles using different innovative approaches, they are also focusing on the development of these nanoparticles in different forms such as shell-core, alloy and contact aggregate. The reason why bimetallic nanoparticles have received so much attention is that it is possible to create a digsy degree of freedom by using bimetalization.

Bimetals are strong optical absorbers and their presence leads to effective heating of fluids that are exposed to laser radiation at the appropriate wavelength. The surface coating of bimetals can affect the longitudinal surface plasmon resonance position and thus the photothermal conversion efficiency and should be considered. In addition, the geometry of the irradiated configuration is very important. For example, when very small volumes are irradiated at a transparent plastic laser plate, at least 97% of the laser energy is lost as a result of conduction or convection into the medium or transmission through the sample, leaving only 3%. .

  in the amount of liquid. In addition, convective and conductive heat transfer creates the temperature distribution of the test solution in the laser [23]. Nevertheless, the temperature rise required to induce hyperthermia can be readily achieved after 5 min even in such geometries using CW laser irradiation of appropriate wavelength and sufficient power. These insights and measurements may be useful when designing future studies of bimetallic-induced plasmonic heating in tissues or cell cultures.

In this research, silver nanoparticles and silver nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed in UV glue with a low refractive index and coated on the surface of a microfiber to prepare high-sensitivity refractive index probes. Corresponding refractive index sensitivities of 1842.3 nm/RIU and 1769.7 nm/RIU were obtained, respectively, for microfibers made of silver nanoparticles and Talaba nanoparticles with a diameter of ~10 µm and a length of ~6 mm. Silicon nanoparticle modified microfiber with high refractive index sensitivity has also been used to determine ambient temperature with a sensitivity of 2.08 nm/°C. The sensor probe is easily obtained from conventional single-mode optical fiber and can be easily connected to the conventional fiber network to probe high-performance photonic sensors and devices.


When modeling radiative heat transfer, we need to think about how radiation is emitted from one surface and absorbed by other surfaces, as well as how much radiation is exchanged between surfaces. We have discussed diffusion, reflection and transmission in the previous two blog posts in this series, and now we will finish learning the basics of radiative heat transfer modeling by introducing the concept of visibility factors and different methods of calculating radiative heat transfer between surfaces. .

Let us consider two thin flat objects as shown in the figure below. We hypothesize that infrared (IR) light can freely diffuse into the space around these surfaces. This is true in a vacuum and holds true for air and many other gases around room temperature. Cases where it may not be reasonable to assume unattenuated diffusion include:

Infrared absorbing gases, such as water vapor
Gases at high temperature
Gases with finely dispersed particles
Gases that undergo chemical reactions
